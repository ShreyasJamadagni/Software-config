# DuoTone blue dark

A double-hue syntax theme for Atom.

**NOTE:**  All I did for this theme variant is to take the genius work of [simurai](https://github.com/simurai/duotone-dark-syntax) and shift the Hue from purple into blue and the orange hue to a yellower orange.  I find this a bit more pleasant to my eyes.  Try the original first, though.

## From the original README:

DuoTone dark uses only 2 hues (blue & gold) and 7 shades in total. It __tones down__ less important parts (like punctuation and brackets) and highlights only the __important__ ones. This leads to a more calm color scheme, but still lets you find the stuff you're looking for.
