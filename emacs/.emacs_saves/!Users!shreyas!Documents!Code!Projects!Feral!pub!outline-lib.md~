#Lib.

This folder contains the extensions of each class. Like variables, functions, methods, etc.
But the unusual thing is that the classes in this folder are the super classes and the classes in the doc folder are subclasses. I have done it like this becuase the classes in the doc folder need the extra functions and their own functions and this is best done by inheritance.

The classes/methods in this folder will start with ' _ '. For example- if I want the class name to be "Tokens", the class name in the code would be "_tokens"(witout the font and style that you see. Just simply 'tokens' with an underscore in the start.)
